# Challenge1
Alessandro Ciceri, 225331

The repository is organized as following:
  - Classic: it contains the code for the basic request of the challenge, so the Armijo method with given function and gradient

To run the wanted method, go in the respectively folder, then it is sufficient to run 'make', then './main'

In the following part I'll describe the folders content one by one
# Classic
  In this folder there is the Makefile, the main and then the header and source code of functions, where are declared and defined all the methods.
  In the main there is the definition of the function which minimum point is wanted and its gradient, along with all the needed parameters and the call of the method defined to find the minimum
  In functions there is the method to find the minimum point using vectors of arbitrary dimension, and other methods and operator to make the code easier to read.
